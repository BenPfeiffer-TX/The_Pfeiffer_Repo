BactMotion_V2
Summer Research project as well as Senior Research project during my time at Trinity University

This is a Matlab program that takes TIRF microscopy footage of e. coli bacteria as input, and determines their 3D orientation as they swim around in a fluid using numerical approximations and fitting algorithms.
For a more in-depth explanation, please refer to my Senior Report on the project here:  https://www.overleaf.com/read/wvjtxyyrtppn
